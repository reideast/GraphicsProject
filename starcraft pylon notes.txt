sc1 pylon
    ring:
        either 2 or 4 sections with fairly small break
    fiddly bits:
        fiddly bits are pointed, tapering teeth things
        curve inward top and bottom
        4 per section (but may vary)
        some barely project over ring
        some longer
    coloured ring:
        extra ring about 1/2 height of ring around outside
    crystal:
        edges are bright white

sc2 pylon
    outer ring:
        ring is unbroken with 4 curvy fiddly bits at cardinal directions
    inner ring:
        ring is 9/10 height of outer. There are two segments, each a little over 1/4 of circumference. Each has 1 fiddly bit in centre
    crystal:
        edges are very light/white-blue. each facet is an tall, uneven rhombus


StarCraft uses an isometric projection [REF Roper]. It was assumed it was an equal 120 degree projection, and a bounding box was drawn around the reference image with that projection, using the SSR30(deg) technique described in [REF Kovalenko] to make an isometric box out of simple distortions of a square. The bounding box was moved and resized and to touch at control points manually identified at the outer radius of the reference object. The box was measured to centimeter dimensions, and this was used as the ratio to construct the X3D object.
One source of error was that the projection angle is a bit shallower than 120 degrees--it appears to be a dimetric projection [REF Kovalenko] With close inspection, it can be seen from the squared-off texture on the ground in the reference image that the bounding box does not match that angle. Additionally, a cylinder drawn with the dimensions of the bounding box does not match the object's "ring". However, measurements at this low pixel resolution were deemed to be precise enough (balanced against the effort required to re-work the bounding box in the tools utilised).

"BR: The game play area is an isometric view - not top down like Warcraft. Also, all of the units in Starcraft are fully rendered, unlike the units in Warcraft which were rendered and then greatly retouched by hand, thus giving them a much more animated look. Starcraft units ave a very high tech and sleek look - very different than WarII."

height of crystal is 11.2 cm
radius of crystal is 1.83 cm, diameter is 3.67 cm
height of ring is 1.45 cm
radius of ring is 3.74 cm, diameter is 7.48 cm

validate to pixel measure
7.48:11.2 = 0.66785714285714285714285714285714


conversion to scale for use in X3D:
take 11.2 cm to be 100 units (arbitrary)
100
    height of crystal is 11.2 cm
    11.2 * 11.2/100 = 100
16.3
    radius of crystal is 1.83 cm
    1.83 * 11.2/100 = 16.3
12.9
    height of ring is 1.45 cm
    1.45 * 11.2/100 = 12.9
33.4
    radius of ring is 3.74 cm
    3.74 * 11.2/100 = 33.4
